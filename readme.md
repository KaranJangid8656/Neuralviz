# Neuralviz - Interactive Neural Network Visualization

An interactive 3D visualization of neural networks using Three.js. This project creates beautiful, dynamic network structures that respond to user interaction with pulsing effects and color changes.

## Features

- **4 Different Network Formations**:
  - Quantum Cortex: A structured, hierarchical network with primary axes and rings
  - Hyperdimensional Mesh: A complex mesh using 4 dimensions
  - Neural Vortex: A dynamic structure with spiral arms
  - Synaptic Cloud: An organic, cloud-like structure with clusters

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Click/Tap to create energy pulses through the network
  - Drag to rotate the view
  - Theme selector with 4 different color palettes
  - Density control slider
  - Formation switcher
  - Pause/Play and Reset Camera controls

- **Visual Effects**:
  - Bloom effect for glowing nodes and connections
  - Film grain effect
  - Dynamic color transitions
  - Energy pulse waves
  - Starfield background



## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- WebGL for hardware acceleration
- Custom GLSL shaders
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
